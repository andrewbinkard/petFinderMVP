Minimum Viable Product project completed during Hack Reactor Software Engineering Immersive - September 2020

* Primarily front-end application which displays pets available for adoption based on location

## Development Process
* Employed MVP strategies to create an app in a limited timeframe (two days)
* Utilized and interacted with a live API to return data on pets available for adoption based on a desired species and location input
* Utilized bootstrap to create a user-friendly and responsive interface using React and React Hooks
* Future development plans include deployment of a backend and account/login functionality to allow users to interact more deeply with the data, such as being able to “favorite” certain pets and track their adoption status.
